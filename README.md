#### presubmission questions:

* What observations or questions do you have about what you’ve learned so far?
  Everything is good, but I really wish if we can discuss the task before lab time, or at the beginning, like come over all requirments and give hints for the critical ideas.
* How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?
  It takes about 4 hrs, I thought only within two hrs it will be done.
